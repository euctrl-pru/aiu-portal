    "text": "Background\nFollowing the Decisions of the EUROCONTROL Permanent Commission in 1997 an independent performance review system addressing all aspects of air traffic management was established as of 1998, and the Performance Review Commission (PRC) was created to provide independent advice on Air Navigation Services (ANS) performance in the EUROCONTROL Member States.\nHence, the first pan-European performance review system was created by EUROCONTROL for its Member States in 1998 as a light touch system consisting of independent performance monitoring and target setting at pan-European level. It helps States, ANSPs, airports and other interested parties to see their performance from a European perspective and to identify good practices and areas that need improvement."

    "text": "Tasks\nThe purpose of the independent Performance Review Commission (PRC) is “to ensure the effective management of the European Air Navigation Services (ANS) system through a strong, transparent and independent performance review system”, per Article 1 of its Terms of Reference.\nEUROCONTROL and the European Union have a long-standing relationship and history of cooperation in ATM and in the implementation of the Single European Sky (SES) and other related policies. Of central importance is the contribution that the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System and the Performance Scheme of the Single European Sky (SES) jointly make towards improving the overall performance of air navigation services and network functions. The PRU provides support to the European Commission (EC) under a service contract, signed in 2017, which runs for four years. Activities include, inter alia, support to monitoring, target setting and assessment of performance plans. The PRU also supports the EC, its Agencies and Advisory Bodies under a longer-term co-operation agreement. The PRC’s work avoids potential overlaps with that of the Performance Review Body (PRB) which assists the European Commission (EC) in the implementation of the SES Performance Scheme. The PRC/PRU tasks can be categorised as follows:\n\nData collection and analysis: Collection and analysis of performance-related data and make independent recommendations to the EUROCONTROL States;\nReporting: Provision of impartial, independent and unbiased information to facilitate stakeholder dialogue. The PRC publishes an annual PRR and an annual ATM Cost-Effectiveness (ACE) Benchmarking report. In 2019, the PRC placed more focus on researching specific topics, in consultation with stakeholders, and in publishing the results as PRC Technical Notes. The PRC is constantly reviewing its work programme to ensure that it remains relevant and useful to stakeholders. It publishes “Performance Insight” short papers on topical themes The Aviation Intelligence Portal (www.ansperformance.eu) provides a variety of interactive dashboards for more detailed analysis and offers monthly updates of performance information covering all EUROCONTROL Member States.\nResearch and development: Conducting of research to further improve the performance measurement framework and to test new indicators;\nInternational benchmarking: Provision of assistance to ICAO and other regions of the world in benchmarking different systems and promoting/developing harmonised standards for data collection and sharing, including the establishment of an open data platform for performance benchmarking. The PRU ensures a strong input to the global developments of the performance based approach benefitting from the European experience."

In performing its tasks, the PRU maintains transparent working arrangements with service providers, airspace user organisations and the industry.\nIn addition to the work carried out for the PRC within the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System, the PRU provides support to the European Commission (EC) in relation to the collection, validation, pre-analysis and provision of performance-related data for performance review in support of the Single European Sky (SES) Performance and Charging Schemes. The PRU also supports the official Single European Sky (SES) Performance Dashboard.\nThe EUROCONTROL Performance Review System and the SES Performance Scheme both contribute to improving the overall performance of air navigation services and network functions for general air traffic for the benefit of all aviation stakeholders, especially the travelling public, by applying the principles of complementarity, cooperation and synergy between them.\nThe SES Performance Scheme provides the legislative/regulatory framework for setting targets for key performance indicators, assessing the respective performance plans of the SES Member States/Functional Airspace Blocks and subsequently monitoring achieved performance against those. The EUROCONTROL Performance Review System complements the SES Performance Scheme by providing the performance view on all the EUROCONTROL Member States and carrying out research and development into the longer-term evolution of ANS performance review including benchmarking with regions outside Europe.\nFor feedback or questions please contact us at: Performance Review Unit (PRU-Support@eurocontrol.int)."
