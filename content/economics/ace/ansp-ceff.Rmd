This web page presents ANSPs individual reports (2-pager), which are updated each year after the publication of the final ACE report. The current version reflects the 2023 data submitted by ANSPs in July 2024 and thoroughly reviewed by the PRU.

The reports show developments in economic cost-effectiveness, financial cost-effectiveness (and its main components) over a five-year period. They also present how ANSPs perform within their respective comparator groups, the trends in capital expenditures, and the main projects driving these investments.
