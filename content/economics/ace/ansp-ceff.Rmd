<b>Draft ANSPs individual cost-effectiveness performance reports for review by the ACE Working Group</b><br>
<span style="color: red;"><b>Do not share this page outside of the ACE Working Group</b></span>

This web page presents ANSPs individual reports (2-pager), which are updated each year after the publication of the final ACE report. The current version reflects the draft 2023 data submitted by ANSPs in July 2024. 

The reports show developments in economic cost-effectiveness, financial cost-effectiveness (and its main components) over a five-year period. They also presents how ANSPs perform within their respective comparator groups, the trends in capital expenditures, and the main projects driving these investments.
