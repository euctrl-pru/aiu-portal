<p>The <a href="/methodology/horizontal-flight-efficiency-pi/">horizontal en-route flight efficiency indicator</a> is computed for three different trajectories: (1) the actual flown trajectory, (2) the planned trajectory according to the flight plan and (3) the shortest constrained route provided by the Network Manager. It is expressed as a ratio of distances and is therefore an average per distance within a given airspace (distance achieved per distance flown).</p>
<ul>
<li>The shortest constraint route (SCR) reflects the effect of the constraints imposed by ANSPs (route structure, airspace availability, etc.) on flight planning. It is not influenced by weather conditions or specific airline considerations, and it sets the limits within which the airlines can optimise.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The filed flight plan takes into consideration not only those constraints, but also other factors which are linked to airlinesâ€™ preferences (including cost considerations and trade-offs). The filed flight plan must always be at least as long as, if not longer than, the SCR.</li>
<li>Finally, the actual flown trajectory is based on the flight plan but is influenced by unforeseen or unplannable factors at the time of filing, including weather and tactical ATC routings. Some of these modifications might lead to a lengthening of the trajectory, while others will lead to a shortening of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Horizontal en-route inefficiencies impact in terms of fuel burn and emissions. The lower the efficiency, the higher the additional fuel consumption and emissions. The results are available for download in our <a href="/data/">data repository</a>.</p>
