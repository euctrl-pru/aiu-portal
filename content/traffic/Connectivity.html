<div class="ml-2">
<p>This page provides an interactive dashboard showing direct <strong>connectivity</strong> between airports in the EUROCONTROL area. Connectivity in aviation and, more generally in the field of transport, can be measured in different ways using many different indicators, each with a specific purpose, advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>This dashboard is a first attempt at illustrating the question “where can you fly from a specific European airport, and with which operator(s)”. For this purpose, we have chosen the simplest indicator - <strong>direct scheduled airport pairs</strong>. The dashboard tracks this and other complementary indicators over time and offers the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ‘Summary’ view at European level showing the top 10 airports with the largest number of direct scheduled connections, and the top 5 airports with the highest increase/decrease in number of connection compared to the previous year.</li>
<li>An ‘Airport view’ with two components:
<ul>
<li>An ‘Overview’ showing the main indicators for the period selected (year, month, week), including a breakdown per region and market segment, the top 10 connected airports and aircraft operator groups<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> with the highest daily frequency. It also shows the weekly evolution of the number of direct scheduled connections since January 2024.</li>
<li>An interactive ‘Map’ that lets users visualise the different routes from the selected airport, and when a route is clicked, view the aircraft operator groups serving the route along with their respective frequencies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Disclaimer: Note that the dashboard tracks <strong>past connectivity</strong>, i.e. flights that have taken place in the selected period. It does not consider the currently planned airline schedules, so any conclusions drawn from it, should be within this context.</p>
<p>The dashboard can be considered a ‘beta’ version aimed at gathering feedback and suggestions from users, so feel free to contact the <a href="mailto:aviation-intelligence@eurocontrol.int">Aviation Intelligence Unit</a>.</p>
<p><small>Please note that the dashboard may take a few moments to load.</small></p>
