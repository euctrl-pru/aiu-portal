<h3>1.2 MOVEMENTS, FLOWS, FLIGHTS, TRAFFIC</h3>
<div id="movement" class="section level4">
<h4>1.2.1 Movement</h4>
<p>The association of a flight stage with an airspace volume or two-dimensional area. Each such association is bounded in time by 2 flight stage events: begin/entry and end/exit. In relation to an airspace volume, movement can be interrupted. In relation to two-dimensional area, movement cannot be interrupted.
Movements are divided to Internals, Arrivals, Departures and Overflights.</p>
</div>
<div id="arrival" class="section level4">
<h4>1.2.2 Arrival</h4>
<p>Arrival is a movement, which starts with the entry into the airspace volume or two-dimensional area. It ends with arrival at an aerodrome belonging to the airspace volume or two-dimensional area considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="departure" class="section level4">
<h4>1.2.3 Departure</h4>
<p>Departure is a movement, which starts on aerodrome belonging to the airspace volume or two-dimensional area considered. It ends with exit from the airspace volume or two-dimensional area considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="internal" class="section level4">
<h4>1.2.4 Internal</h4>
<p>Internal is a movement, which starts with departure aerodrome and ends with arrival aerodrome both belonging to the airspace volume or two-dimensional area considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="overflight" class="section level4">
<h4>1.2.5 Overflight</h4>
<p>Overflight is a movement, which starts with entry and ends with exit of the airspace volume considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples-of-movements" class="section level4">
<h4>Examples of movements:</h4>
<p>Let’s assume France’s airspace is the airspace volume considered. Every movement, which passes over France, falls into one and only one of the four categories: departures, arrivals, overflights, and internals.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the movement started and ended in France then it is called <strong>internal</strong>.</li>
<li>If a movement started in France but it ended abroad then it is a <strong>departure</strong>.</li>
<li>If a flight stage started in a foreign country and the movement entered to the French airspace volume and ended in a French airport then it is called an <strong>arrival</strong>.</li>
<li>Finally a movement which passes over France but never lands there is called an <strong>overflight</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the airspace volume considered changes, the same flight stage would be counted differently in terms of movements. Let’s think about a flight stage from Germany to France.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the perspective of the NM Area this flight stage will be counted as an <strong>internal</strong> movement.</li>
<li>From the perspective of German airspace volume, this flight stage will be counted as <strong>departure</strong> movement, and</li>
<li>from the perspective of French airspace volume it will be counted as an <strong>arrival</strong> movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>A flight stage can be an internal movement for airspace volume but also an overflight for another airspace volume. Guernsey to London is an internal UK movement which overflies France.</p>
<p>An airspace volume with no airports (e.g. Maastricht UAC airspace) can have only overflights.</p>
<p>An airport cannot have overflights.</p>
