<h2>Data source</h2>
<p>The data is supplied by the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/aviation-sustainability" title="EUROCONTROL Aviation Sustainability Unit">EUROCONTROL Aviation Sustainability Unit</a>.</p>

<h2>Data description</h2>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were calculated with the EUROCONTROL <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/tool/small-emitters-tool" title="small emitters tool">Small Emitters Tool (SET)</a>,
which enables to estimate the fuel burn and associated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for an entire flight.
Hence, the results reflect total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from controlled flights rather than ANSP/ATM performance.</p>
<p>The <strong>total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for each State</strong> were calculated based on <strong>departing <a href="/acronym/ifr/">IFR</a> flights</strong>
billed by the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/crco" title="EUROCONTROL Route Charges Office">EUROCONTROL Route Charges Office</a>,
<strong>aircraft type</strong> and <strong>actual flown distance</strong> (full trajectory from origin to destination).</p>
<p>For instance, the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the full trajectory of a flight from Brussels to
New York would be included in the results for Belgium.
A flight from New York to Brussels would however NOT be included in the results for Belgium.</p>

<p>Certain States’ emissions have been aggregated specially:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the Excel file the STATE_NAME is marked with a ’*’ and the relevant info can be found in the META sheet.</li>
<li>for CSV files an extra column NOTE has been added to note the special treatment (TRUE)
<ul>
<li>UNITED KINGDOM includes emissions for JERSEY, GUERNESEY, ISLE OF MAN</li>
<li>CYPRUS includes emissions for UK Sovereign Military bases on the island.</li>
<li>NORWAY includes emissions for Jan Mayen and Slavbarden.</li>
<li>DANEMARK includes emissions for FAROE ISLANDS.</li>
<li>PORTUGAL includes emissions for Azores and Madeira.</li>
<li>SPAIN does NOT included emissions for Canary Islands which are under ‘CANARY ISLANDS’.</li>
<li>FRANCE emissions do NOT include those for French overseas territories.</li>

<h2>When to use this data</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Small Emitters Tool (SET)</strong> CO₂ emissions dataset when you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>State-focused view</strong> of total CO₂ emissions based on <strong>departing IFR flights</strong>, regardless of where the emissions occur during the flight.</li>
<li>A <strong>longer historical time series</strong>, with data available from <strong>January 2010 up to last month</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Regular and timely updates</strong> — this dataset is updated <strong>monthly</strong>, making it useful for operational reporting, trend analysis, and monitoring.</li>
<li>A dataset aligned with <strong>EUROCONTROL billing and traffic records</strong>.</li>
<li>A methodology that estimates total flight emissions using aircraft type and full trajectory length (origin to destination).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: This dataset only includes CO₂ emissions and does not distinguish by flight phase or geographic airspace.</em></p>
