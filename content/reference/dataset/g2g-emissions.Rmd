## Data source
The data is supplied by the [EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit][pru] and the [EUROCONTROL Aviation Sustainability Unit][env].

## Data description
The CO<sub>2</sub>/NOX<sub>X</sub>/SO<sub>X</sub> emissions were calculated with the [EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit][pru] and the [EUROCONTROL Aviation Sustainability Unit][env] Gate-to-Gate methodology which employs the [Advanced Emission Model (AEM)][aem] which is developed in the EUROCONTROL Innovation Hub by the [EUROCONTROL Aviation Sustainability Unit][aem]. The values provided in this data set are the historical emissions as displayed on the [EUROCONTROL FlyingGreen Platform][FG_NZ]. 
  
As explained on the [FlyingGreen Platform][FG_INFO], emission values are calculated with EUROCONTROL tool, Advance Emission Model, and based on the best available actual trajectory data available to EUROCONTROL. The FlyingGreen platform allows the user to select the methodology ('Area Focus' or 'Trajectory (UNFCCC) methodology'), the area of interest , and the traffic of interest (Flight type - DAIO) and returns the fuel burn and emission values based on the user's selection.

The past emissions are being presented using two different methodologies (these can be selected as filter options on the FlyingGreen platform):
 
 * <b>Trajectory (UNFCCC) methodology </b> with a State focus where the full trajectory of flight is considered; or
 * <b>Area focus</b> where the fuel burn and emissions are calculated only within the selected area and depending on the traffic selected (traffic type filer differentiating between departures, arrival and intra flights).

The data in these data sets provided here represent the <b>Area focus</b> methodology. In upcoming releases the available data will be expanded.  The gate-to-gate emissions provided here are calculated taking into account the individual trajectories (from gate-to-gate) of each flight and are modeled for all flight phases:

  * taxi-out
  * take-off
  * cruise
  * landing
  * taxi-in 

Subsequently these emissions are aggregated by the following variables: 
  
  * Area (Network or State)
  * Flight Type (DAIO)
  * Market Segment
  * Flight Phase

For more information on the methodologies see the description under ['READ MORE' for NetZero on FlyingGreen][FG_INFO].

## When to use this data

Use the **Gate-to-Gate Emissions** dataset when you need:

- **Detailed approach and granular estimates** of emissions based on actual flight trajectories and modeled with the **Advanced Emission Model (AEM)**.
- Emissions data that includes not only **CO₂**, but also **NOₓ** and **SOₓ**, distributed across **flight phases** (e.g., taxi-out, cruise, landing, etc.).
- Emissions **geographically attributed to the airspace or State where they occurred**, using the **Area Focus methodology**.
- Disaggregation by **flight type (DAIO)** and **market segment**, supporting detailed environmental performance analysis.
- Data coverage from **2019 onwards**, based on available historical emissions as published on the **FlyingGreen Platform**.

> *Note: This dataset is not yet updated monthly — the update process is being developed and will be available in the future.*
