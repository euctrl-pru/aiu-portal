The China/Europe comparison reports are joint publications by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL). The latest report represents the second iteration of the bi-regional ANS Performance comparison between China and Europe. The report was jointly developed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China Operation Supervisory Center (CAACOSC), Civil Aviation University of China (CAUC), Aviation Data Communication Corp. (ADCC), and the Performance Review Unit (PRU) of EUROCONTROL.

The objective was to make a factual high-level comparison of operational air navigation system performance in China and Europe. The initial focus was to develop a set of comparable performance measures and harmonised data feeds in order to create a sound basis for such a factual high-level comparisons between both regions. The specific performance indicators are based on best practices from both groups and ICAOâ€™s Global Air Navigation Plan.
