To meet the challenges of the future, the successful and targeted deployment of agreed transformation steps is required. 

With the aim of identifying, reviewing and championing successful transformation projects based on the ATM Master Plan and the European Green Deal, the EUROCONTROL [Performance Review Commission (PRC)](/about/prc/) has produced a <a href="/transformation/">Transformation Support Strategy</a>. 

In this process, the PRC aims to identify flagship projects, monitor their performance over time, help stakeholders understand the challenges involved in implementing these innovative transformational projects and the resulting benefits, and thus stimulate and encourage improvements in ATM. 

To engage key executive stakeholders in this process, in February 2023 the PRC hosted a workshop entitled ‘In search of flagships for ATM transformation,’ which sought to better understand the business-level benefits of delivering transformations and overcoming the challenges rather than focussing on operational and technical details. In particular, the workshop aimed to identify disruptive, innovative and scalable flagships which have the potential to make a substantial contribution to the performance of the ATM system in Europe over the coming years. This policy brief summarises the main takeaways from the workshop discussions.
