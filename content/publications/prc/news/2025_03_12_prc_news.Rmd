To meet the challenges of the future, the successful and targeted deployment of agreed transformation steps is required. 

With the aim of identifying, reviewing and championing successful transformation projects based on the ATM Master Plan and the European Green Deal, the EUROCONTROL [Performance Review Commission (PRC)](/about/prc/) has produced a <a href="/transformation/">Transformation Support Strategy</a>. 

The PRC aims to identify flagship projects, monitor their performance over time, help stakeholders understand the challenges involved in implementing these innovative transformational projects and the resulting benefits, and thus stimulate and encourage improvements in ATM. 

In order to involve key stakeholders in this process, the PRC, together with the Florence School of Regulation Transport Area, hosted a workshop in February 2023 entitled "<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/publications/prc/news/2023_05_16_prc_news/">In search of flagships for ATM transformation</a>" to identify a series of disruptive, innovative and potentially scalable flagship projects. 

A second workshop took place in November 2023 entitled "<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/publications/prc/news/2024_02_09_prc_news/">ATM transformation flagships – continuing the journey</a>" with the aim to determine more precisely each flagship´s impact on performance.

The third TSS workshop, held in November 2024 and facilitated by Leiden University’s International Institute of Air and Space Law, followed up on the previous workshops held in 2023 with the aim of assessing the progress in implementing transformative ATM technologies and identifying the ongoing challenges in the European aviation sector.

This policy brief summarises the main takeaways from the 3rd workshop discussions.
